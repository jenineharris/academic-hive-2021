# Academic Hive 2021 Research Bootcamp

## Getting Started in R 

R is a statistical software that is <a href = "https://www.r-project.org">free, open-source, and can run on most operating systems</a>. This means that anyone in the world with access to a computer and the internet can use it and anyone in the world can contribute to the development of new tools in R. 

R can do everything that paid statistical software like SPSS and SAS can do, and often more! <a href = "http://r4stats.com/2019/05/28/data-science-jobs-report-2019-python-way-up-tensorflow-growing-rapidly-r-use-double-sas/">Analysis of data on job openings and other metrics</a> shows that R is increasingly included as a desired or required skill, often surpassing traditional closed source software like SPSS and SAS. R is particularly great for **data management** and developing amazing **data visualizations**. This workshop is designed to get you started using R.
