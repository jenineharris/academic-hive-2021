### Getting Started in R Workshop Instructions

R is a statistical software that is <a href = "https://www.r-project.org">free, open-source, and can run on most operating systems</a>. This means that anyone in the world with access to a computer and the internet can use it and anyone in the world can contribute to the development of new tools in R. 

R can do everything that paid statistical software like SPSS and SAS can do, and often more! <a href = "http://r4stats.com/2019/05/28/data-science-jobs-report-2019-python-way-up-tensorflow-growing-rapidly-r-use-double-sas/">Analysis of data on job openings and other metrics</a> shows that R is increasingly included as a desired or required skill, often surpassing traditional closed source software like SPSS and SAS. R is particularly great for **data management** and developing amazing **data visualizations**. This workshop is designed to get you started using R. 

The work in this workshop is designed to take you about **3 hours** to complete from start to finish. The length of the workshop will vary somewhat depending on the speed of your internet connection and your computer experience and comfort level. The activities are divided into:

<ul>
  <li> Installing R and R Studio
  <li> Learning about the features of R Studio
  <li> Importing and cleaning data in R
  <li> Creating basic tables and figures in R 
</ul>


### Step 1: Installing R and R Studio

R is the software and R Studio is the IDE (Interactive Development Environment) that makes R easier to use. Install R **before** you install R Studio because R Studio will look for R during installation.

First, download and install R:

<ul>
  <li> Click the <b>download R</b> link on the <a href = "https://www.r-project.org">R Project for Statistical Computing</a> website
  <li> Choose one of the options from the <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">CRAN Mirrors</a> list (it doesn't matter which one!)
  <li> Click on the download that is appopropriate for your operating system, Linux, Mac, or Windows; if you are not given this option, go back to the <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">CRAN Mirrors</a> and try a different one
  <li> Find the link for <b>install R for the first time</b> and click on it
  <li> Click on the the <b>Download R</b> link on the page that opens
  <li> Use the installer that downloads to install R 
</ul>

Second, download and install R Studio:

<ul>
  <li> Go to the R Studio <a href = "https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/"> downloads page</a> 
  <li> Click on the DOWNLOAD button under the RStudio Desktop column on the downloads page
  <li> Choose the Download for the operating system you have and click on it  
  <li> Use the installer that downloads to install R Studio 
</ul>

### Step 2: Learn about the features of R Studio 

Watch a short introduction to the <a href = "https://youtu.be/6bZGlHmssPI">R Studio Interface</a>.

### Step 3: Coding Part 1 - Importing and cleaning data in R

First, download the participant files and save them together in the same folder on your computer:

<ul>
  <li> Click on the green <b>Code</b> button toward the top of this GitHub page 
  <li> Choose Download ZIP
  <li> Unzip the downloaded zip file and save all the files in a single folder on your computer 
</ul>

Second, watch and follow along with this video: https://youtu.be/gSuZHoOenQ8
